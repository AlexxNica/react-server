# react-server monorepo [![Build Status][build-badge-img]][build-url]

React pages that render on the server for blazing fast page load and in the
browser for seamless transitions from page to page.

# Just getting started with `react-server`?

Start with [`react-server-cli`](packages/react-server-cli), which will take
care of the _server_ part and get you up and running right away.

Once you're hungry for more dig into
[`react-server`](packages/react-server) itself.

# Monorepo?

It's a thing, now.  All the cool kids are doing it, like [React](https://github.com/facebook/react/tree/master/packages), [Meteor](https://github.com/meteor/meteor/tree/devel/packages), [Ember](https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/tree/master/packages), and [Babel](https://github.com/babel/babel/tree/master/packages).  All of the packages are versioned in lockstep, which makes it easier for us to make strong guarantees about the interoperability of the packages that work together in the react-server ecosystem.
