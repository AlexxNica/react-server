# Monorepo?

It's a thing, now.  All the cool kids are doing it, like [React](https://github.com/facebook/react/tree/master/packages), [Meteor](https://github.com/meteor/meteor/tree/devel/packages), [Ember](https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/tree/master/packages), and [Babel](https://github.com/babel/babel/tree/master/packages).  All of the packages are versioned in lockstep, which makes it easier for us to make strong guarantees about the interoperability of the packages that work together in the react-server ecosystem.

# react-server?
The best place to start is [react-server's README](packages/react-server/README.md)), though you will likely want to read all of [react-server's docs](packages/react-server/docs).
