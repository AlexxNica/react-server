React framework with server render for blazing fast page load and seamless
transitions between pages in the browser.

#### Just getting started with `react-server`?

Start with [`react-server-cli`](packages/react-server-cli), which will take
care of the _server_ part and get you up and running right away.

Once you're hungry for more dig into
[`react-server`](packages/react-server) itself.
